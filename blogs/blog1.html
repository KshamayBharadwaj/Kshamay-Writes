      <p>Public speaking was never my strength. I was always the shy one, struggling to express my thoughts easily and overthinking that I might be wasting others' time. This fear stuck with me throughout my life and especially during my college years, where I was pushed into situations that demanded me to step out of my comfort zone.</p>

      <h2>The Beginning: Shyness & Self-Doubt</h2>
      <p>From the start, I had always been nervous about speaking in front of others. My fear of public speaking didn’t develop over time; it had been there since I was young. I avoided speaking in front of a group, partly because I felt I couldn’t express myself clearly and was worried about what others would think.</p>

      <h2>The First Big Challenge: Pitching My Idea</h2>
      <p>My first big challenge came during a college ideathon, where I had to pitch an idea alone. I remember being so nervous that I wanted to back out. The thought of speaking in front of others, especially people from different years of college, made me anxious. But peer pressure got to me, and I decided to give it a try.</p>

      <h2>Preparing for the Pitch</h2>
      <p>Since I was the only member in the team, I didn’t prepare too much for the actual pitch. I had researched my idea thoroughly, but when it came to presenting, I didn’t know how I would express everything clearly. I had the knowledge, but I couldn’t translate my thoughts into words effectively.</p>

      <h2>The Pitch: Nervous, But Pushing Through</h2>
      <p>When I finally stood up to present, my mind was filled with doubt. I knew what I needed to say, but the words didn’t come out smoothly. It felt like my thoughts were stuck, and I couldn’t express them as clearly as I had hoped. Even though I struggled, I kept going and finished the pitch. It was a huge relief when it was over.</p>

      <h2>Feedback & Motivation</h2>
      <p>After the pitch, the judges gave me feedback, saying that for a first-year student, I had done well and encouraged me to keep going. They appreciated the fact that I started early in my journey. That feedback meant a lot to me and boosted my confidence significantly. I realized that people don't expect perfection, and their support made me feel like I could improve with time.</p>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Don’t Overthink:</strong> The audience isn’t judging you as much as you think. They’re more focused on the message, not on how perfectly it’s delivered.</li>
        <li><strong>Preparation is Key:</strong> Even though I didn’t prepare my pitch as much as I should have, I realized that better preparation would have made the process smoother.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Helps:</strong> Positive feedback can be a huge confidence booster, but constructive criticism helps you improve.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Pushing Yourself:</strong> Public speaking may always have a little bit of nervousness, but the more you do it, the easier it becomes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>Since that event, my confidence has definitely grown. Although the fear of public speaking still affects me at times, I know that with practice and experience, I’ll continue to improve. I’m determined to make the next event better, and I’m not backing down from new challenges.</p>

      <h2>To Anyone Struggling with Public Speaking</h2>
      <p>If you’re someone who gets nervous about speaking in front of people, I want to leave you with one piece of advice: <strong>Don’t overthink what the audience is thinking. They don’t have that much time to focus on you. Just do your thing, and focus on getting your message across.</strong> The more you practice, the more confident you’ll become.</p>
